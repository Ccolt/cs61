DO NOT GRADE UNTIL 9/24 at 11:59 - Taking a late day :/

Grading notes (if any)
----------------------

I'm getting an invalid free error that I can't solve in heavy hitters, but everything else 
seems to be fine. I think my heavy hitters code should work, I just can't confirm
since I can't figure out what's wrong with hhtest.cc, or maybe my m61_free function?

Extra credit attempted (if any)
