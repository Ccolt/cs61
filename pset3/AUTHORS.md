I worked with Aashim Vaish as my partner. We shared code but differentiated towards the end.

He received help from Jambay Kinley, as well.

I also have a group chat with Matt Li, Timoka Kan, Austin Rayne Sams, Justin Zhu, and Raymond Wang, where we discuss pset issues. I didn't work directly with them on this one, though.
