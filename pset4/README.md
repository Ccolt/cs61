Grading notes (if any)
----------------------

I wasn't able to get rid of all my memory leaks. I still have one that seems to cause
roughly every other 'free' to fail somehow, making every other page inaccessible to
future alloc's. I've tried for a few hours to find it with no luck, so since I'm already
past the deadline I've decided to simply turn it in and hope for partial credit, I suppose. 

Extra credit attempted (if any)
