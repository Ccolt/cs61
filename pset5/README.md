Grading notes (if any)
----------------------

I really tried my best on this Pset, but certain circumstances meant I wasn't able to
get much help on it, so I had to do most of it alone, and because of that there are lots
of issues, and some things I just couldn't figure out.

For pipes, I can't figure out why a lot of my tests are failing, but some are not. I
think it has to do with chaining multiple pipes together, especially when conditionals
are involved.

For interrupts, I wrote code that I thought should work. It compiles, but doesn't pass any
of the tests and I haven't been able to figure out why. I think it might have to do with how
I deal with pgids.

Also I apologize for how weirdly my tree is organized. I had a whole plan for it that
didn't end up working, so I ended up making lots of modifications to it until it was
very confusing but somewhat functional, and I was too afraid to restructure it and risk
ruining the progress I'd made.

Please be gentle.
