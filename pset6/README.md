Grading notes (if any)
----------------------

I attempted some extra credit (as I'll describe below), but couldn't get it to work so 
my code won't compile as-is. If you wouldn't mind grading the last commit for correctness,
the commit message should be: "Updated Authors file". 

Extra credit attempted (if any)
-------------------------------

I tried to implement pong paddles by adding a new class modeled after the ball class which
can only travel up and down, and does so non-stop, bouncing balls off if they hit it. 

I was unsure how to make the paddles show up graphically, so I didn't get around to that.

I'm also getting compiler errors that confuse me. They say "struct pong_cell has no 
member named paddle but it clearly does. Maybe I'm missing something obvious but 
I unfortunately don't have the time tonight to figure it out.
